# Not every system resolves the dependencies the same way, unfrotunately.
# In particular, some dev dependencies (staticx) cannot ve resolved on macos.
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
